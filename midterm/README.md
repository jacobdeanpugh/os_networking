# Project Outline

## Introduction

### Malware Detection Software

This malware detection Software will implement **4 malware detection techniques**.

1. **Signature-based detection** - This method will include hashing a suspicious file and comparing it to a database of known malware hashes.
2. **Heuristic-based detection** - This method will include scanning a suspicious file extenstions and names.
3. **Process-based detection** - This method will include scanning processes running on the system, and checking for any malicious activity.

## Objectives

1. **Successfully implement 4 malware detection techniques**.
2. **Create a user-friendly interface for the software**.
3. **Allow for background execution of the software**.

## Tools

1. **Python** - This will be the primary language to implement all malware detection techniques.
2. **Tkinter** - This will be used to create the user interface for the software.
3. **PEFile** - This will be used to analyze Portable Executable files.
4. **PSUtil** - This will be used to analyze processes running on the system.
5. **Hashlib** - This will be used to hash files for signature-based detection.
6. **MalwareBazzar** - This will be used to download malware signatures for signature-based detection.
